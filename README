                                  YARD-Value

  YARD-Value provides YARD¹ handlers for Value² objects.  It’ll document
  whether the Value is Comparable and what attributes are used in such
  comparisons, its #initialize method, and its protected accessors.

¹ See http://yardoc.org/
² See http://disu.se/software/value-1.0/

  You add the documentation to the Module#Value invocation.  Any ‹@param› tags
  are used both for the parameters to the #initialize method and for the
  protected accessors.

  This

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x
      # @param [Integer] y
      Value :x, :y
    end

  generates documentation similar to

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x
      # @param [Integer] y
      def initialize(x, y)
    end

  and this

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x The x coordinate of the receiver
      # @param [Integer] y The y coordinate of the receiver
      Value :x, :y
    end

   generates documentation similar to

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x
      # @param [Integer] y
      def initialize(x, y)

      protected

      # @return [Integer] The x coordinate of the receiver
      attr_reader :x

      # @return [Integer] The y coordinate of the receiver
      attr_reader :y
    end

  For comparable Values, a note is added about what attributes are used in the
  comparison.  This

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x
      # @param [Integer] y
      Value :x, :y, :comparable => true
    end

  is similar to

    class Point
      # A point on a plane.
      # @param [Integer] x
      # @param [Integer] y
      # @note Comparisons between instances are made between x and y.
      def initialize(x, y)
    end

§ Usage

    Add ‹--plugin yard-value-1.0› to your YARD command line.  If you’re
    using Inventory-Rake-Tasks-YARD¹, add the following to your Rakefile:

      Inventory::Rake::Tasks::YARD.new do |t|
        t.options += %w'--plugin yard-value-1.0'
      end

§ Financing

    Currently, most of my time is spent at my day job and in my rather busy
    private life.  Please motivate me to spend time on this piece of software
    by donating some of your money to this project.  Yeah, I realize that
    requesting money to develop software is a bit, well, capitalistic of me.
    But please realize that I live in a capitalistic society and I need money
    to have other people give me the things that I need to continue living
    under the rules of said society.  So, if you feel that this piece of
    software has helped you out enough to warrant a reward, please PayPal a
    donation to now@disu.se¹.  Thanks!  Your support won’t go unnoticed!
